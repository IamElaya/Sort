Inject example: hearts.inject(0) { |value, card| value + card[:value]} (0 = memo goes to first value, then goes to value of card. Return value goes in loop to next one and so on... last one is puts )
  Same as eg. value = 0
      hearts.each do |heart|
      value += heart[:value]
      end


Select example: hearts = @cards.select do |card|
card[:suit] == "hearts"
end

Reduce and inject same thing, reduce is V2.0 because it describes its function.
